        <font size=3 color=#FFFFFF>The Kingdom of Etrea almost entirely consists of Etreans. Their main goals are to
          obtain the Forge of Sin and defeat The Authority. They are the main ruling faction in the Etrean Luminant.
          They use galebreath magic. They had been ruled by kings for generations until the year 1271 where a new
          leader, the
          Lord Regent, appeared. The Regent will hire noble adventurers to retrieve pieces of the forge from The Duke of
          Erisia. He only likes Etreans in his main territory and will murder anyone who dare enter his palace without
          permission. Their is a Canor merchant at the Etrean docks who tells you that the new leader doesn't let Canors
          in town. Royal Guards are deployed to those the Kingdom deems as a considerable threat. While at the Etris
          Docks, a guard may talk about conflict with the Authority. Soon after this rare dialogue, The Authority will
          invade Etris. The entire kingdom can be seen burning during this event and a large onslaught of many Soldiers
          of both Etrean and Authority descent will sprawl onto the scene battling for control of the territory. </font>
