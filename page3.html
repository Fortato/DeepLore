          in a <br>city named The Celtorian City.
          Their <br>city was very wealthy and had the best <br>navy around, however they drowned in <br>their glory when
          the Celtorian Horror <br>appeared. Many celtors have gone
          mad <br>from the insanity the depths causes on <br>ones
          mind and the few left tell tales of <br>the eldritch beast with a mass of <br>tentacles and a beak that erased

          also <br>"understand their destiny" and as such <br>learning new things comes naturally to <br>them. When
          Adrets come of age, they <br>are given a tattoo that represents the <br>path of life they seek. The

            have developed a fist technique <br>being the Way of Navae, which has<br> a basic punch and drop kick
            critical<br> attack. They also use a gremorian <br>longspear which features basic <br>foward swings as well
